    "# Building a Unified Chat Experience with Grok\n",
    "The [xAI documentation](https://docs.x.ai) outlines several ways to interact with Grok: multi-turn [chat](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/chat) conversations, real-time token [streaming](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/streaming-response), [function calling](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/function-calling), [image understanding](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/image-understanding), and [structured responses](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/structured-outputs). While each feature is powerful on its own, combining them into a cohesive application can feel unclear. This guide demonstrates how to integrate these capabilities into a single, practical customer support chatbot, showcasing patterns and code for a seamless chat experience. In practice, a real-world chatbot would be augmented with company policies, FAQs, and tone guidelines, but here we focus on the technical foundations rather than a production-grade implementation."

    "Let's break down what's happening above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Input Triggers the Chat Loop**: The user enters a message (e.g., “I can’t log in”), which is appended to `messages` as a `\"user\"` role entry.\n",
    "2. **Streaming Response Begins**: The app sends the `messages` array to Grok with the `tools` list, requesting a streamed response. Grok processes the input and starts sending chunks.\n",
    "3. **Text and Tool Call Detection**: As chunks arrive, Grok may stream text content (e.g., “I will create a customer ticket for Omar with the issue ‘unable to log in’”) via `chunk.choices[0].delta.content`, displayed in real-time. Simultaneously, it may include one or more `tool_calls` in `chunk.choices[0].delta.tool_calls`. A `for` loop collects all tool calls (e.g., `create_support_ticket`), as Grok can request multiple actions from a single message.\n",
    "4. **Response Completion**: Once the stream ends, the assistant’s full message—text content and any tool calls—is appended to `messages`.\n",
    "5. **Tool Execution**: Each tool call is processed by `_handle_tool_call`. This function uses `self.executables`, a dictionary mapping tool names to callable functions (e.g., `{\"create_customer_ticket\": create_customer_ticket}`), and `self.arguments`, a dictionary of Pydantic schemas (e.g., `{\"create_customer_ticket\": CreateCustomerTicketRequest}`) to validate and parse the JSON arguments. The mock `create_customer_ticket` function might return “Created a ticket for Omar with issue: can't log in” for each relevant call.\n",
    "6. **Append Tool Results**: Results from each tool execution (e.g., “Created ticekt for Omar...\") are appended to `messages` as `\"tool\"` role entries, linked to their respective `tool_call_id`.\n",
    "7. **Follow-up Call to Grok**: With tool calls executed, the updated `messages` array—now including tool results—is sent back to Grok in a new streaming request. Grok processes this and streams a final response (e.g., “I’ve successfully created the customer ticket” or “I was unable to create the ticket” if an error occurred), which is appended to `messages`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process ensures function calls integrate seamlessly into the conversation, with streaming keeping it responsive. The `ChatAppWithTools` class manages this flow, leveraging `self.executables` for execution and `self.arguments` for validation, while looping back to Grok for a final user-facing response based on the tool outcomes."

Grok’s image processing capability extracts details from these images, and with the structured response feature, we can format the output as JSON or Pydantic objects. This makes the data easy to handle for downstream tasks, such as saving to a database or triggering further actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable this, we’ll define a new function, `analyze_receipt_image`, that processes a receipt image and returns a structured Pydantic response containing the extracted contents (e.g., items, totals). The example below demonstrates this as a standalone feature."

    "This guide walked through building a customer support chatbot with Grok, integrating multi-turn conversations, streaming, function calling, and image understanding with structured outputs. Here are the key learnings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stateless API Management**: The chat completion endpoint's stateless nature requires developers to maintain the `messages` array, appending user inputs, assistant responses, and tool results to preserve conversation context across turns.\n",
    "- **Real-time Streaming**: Streaming responses token-by-token enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback, seamlessly integrated into the chat loop.\n",
    "- **Function Calling Flexibility**: Tool calls enable actionable outcomes (e.g., creating support tickets), with Grok generating structured requests that the app executes and loops back for final responses.\n",
    "- **Image Understanding Integration**: Adding image analysis (e.g., receipt parsing) extends functionality, leveraging structured outputs for downstream tasks, and fits effortlessly into the existing tool-calling framework.\n",
    "- **State Inspection**: The `messages` array serves as a log of the conversation state, allowing you to trace each interaction step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "Readers can build on this foundation by:\n",
    "- Augmenting the system prompt with company-specific data (e.g., FAQs, policies) for a more tailored chatbot.\n",
    "- Implementing real tool integrations, such as connecting `create_support_ticket` to a CRM or `analyze_receipt_image` to a database.\n",
    "- Adding error handling for edge cases like network failures or invalid inputs."
