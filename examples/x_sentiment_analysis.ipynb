    "# Real Time Sentiment Analysis with Grok & ùïè\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we'll take a look at the results you can achieve when you combine X's real time data with Grok's natural language understanding, reasoning and intelligence. We'll build a tool that let's us ingest X posts about bitcoin in real time and calculate a score for the market sentiment based on the content of the ingested posts. To do this we'll employ a multi-stage approach that leverages `grok-3-fast`'s speed for filtering/classification and `grok-3-mini`'s reasoning for computing the sentiment score based on the filtered posts. Whilst this guide focus on bitcoin,  the approaches showcased here can easily be adapted for other topics beyond crypto entirely."

    "## High-Level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our tool starts by pulling real-time Bitcoin posts from X using the [Filtered Stream API](https://docs.x.com/x-api/posts/filtered-stream/introduction). We set a broad rule like `‚Äúbitcoin BTC #bitcoin -is:retweet‚Äù` to catch relevant chatter, but not every post matters. Some are noise: ads, spam, or fluff. To tackle this, we use a modular, multi-stage setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs the flow: every 5 posts that match our rule (arbitrary, but adjustable) we batch them and send them to `grok-3-fast`. It‚Äôs fast, so it quickly classifies which ones carry signal‚Äîposts worth scoring‚Äîsaving those and tossing the rest. Once we hit 5 high-signal posts (again, tweakable), we pass that batch to `grok-3-mini` to leverage it's reasoning capability to compute the sentiment score. After that, each new high-signal post joins the batch, and we recalculate the score with the full set. It‚Äôs a rolling update, simple but effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modular design pays off in a few ways. It gives us fine-grained control over each step, since filtering and scoring get their own prompts, they can be tuned independently. If we want to tweak the filtering criteria or swap in a new xAI model later, it‚Äôs a simple change, isolated from the sentiment process and vice-versa. Compare that to a single ‚Äúsuper-prompt‚Äù approach: one tweak there could ripple across everything, muddying the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another perk is how it plays to model strengths. Classification is lightweight, `grok-3-fast`‚Äôs speed handles it well without needing deep reasoning. Sentiment, though, demands more: understanding nuance, sarcasm, or context. That‚Äôs where `grok-3-mini`'s reasoning shines. By splitting the workload this way, we get efficiency and precision, tailored to each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "More broadly, LLMs like Grok are a natural fit for this. Posts roll in from X in all sorts of languages‚Äînot just English‚Äîand Grok handles them effortlessly, no extra training needed. Plus, we can tweak classification or sentiment criteria on the fly by just updating the respective prompts, say, to catch different signals or refine scoring. Unlike traditional ML, where you‚Äôd retrain a model from scratch, this lets us experiment fast and iterate based on what we see.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach outlined above is just one way to do it; you could adjust the batch sizes or only recalculate sentiment with a bigger pile of new posts, depending on your needs."

    "## Working with the Filtered Stream API\n",
    "\n",
    "The Filtered Stream API is an X endpoint that delivers real-time posts based on rules you define. It‚Äôs our pipeline for capturing Bitcoin chatter as it happens. You set up stream rules, apply them, and then listen, any post matching a rule comes through with a tag showing which rule it hit. If you want the full breakdown, check [X‚Äôs API docs](https://docs.x.com/x-api/posts/filtered-stream/introduction). For this guide, it‚Äôs simply our live data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules in the Filtered Stream\n",
    "Rules drive the stream, telling it what posts to grab. You create them with specific keywords, operators, or user filters, then send them to the API to activate. Once live, the stream returns X post data for every match, including a `matching_rules` field to track which rule triggered it. We‚Äôll use a single, broad rule here to catch a wide range of Bitcoin-related posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This keeps things simple, but the setup‚Äôs flexible. You could add multiple rules to widen the net‚Äîsay, one for posts from high-profile investors , another for crypto organizations, and another for wallet trackers. Each rule could target a different angle on sentiment, tagged separately for analysis downstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the rule we'll roll with:"

The third tweet is about Michael Saylor suggesting MicroStrategy might buy more Bitcoin. That\\'s positive, as it shows confidence in Bitcoin\\'s value. The fourth tweet is a prediction of Bitcoin\\'s price decreasing, which is bearish. The last tweet is in Chinese, but it seems to be about preferring to trade Bitcoin short-term rather than other cryptocurrencies, which might be neutral or slightly positive for Bitcoin, as it indicates some interest in trading it.\\n\\nNow, I need to consider the authors\\' influence. The first tweet is from \"Whale Alert,\" which is a well-known account in the crypto space with a large following. That gives it more weight. The second tweet is from an individual user, and without knowing their follower count, I\\'ll assume they have less influence. The third tweet is about Michael Saylor, who is a prominent figure in the crypto world, so that carries significant weight. The fourth tweet is from another individual user, again with unknown influence. The last tweet is also from an individual user, and without context, I\\'ll assume moderate influence.\\n\\nI should also consider the credibility of the sources. Whale Alert is a reputable source for tracking large transactions, so their tweet is credible. Michael Saylor is a well-known advocate for Bitcoin, so his statements carry weight. The other tweets are from individual users, so their credibility is less certain.\\n\\nNow, I need to weigh these sentiments. The first tweet is bearish and from a credible source, so it should have a significant negative impact. The second tweet is also bearish but from a less influential source, so it should have a smaller negative impact. The third tweet is bullish and from a highly influential source, so it should have a significant positive impact. The fourth tweet is bearish but from a less influential source, so it should have a smaller negative impact. The last tweet is neutral or slightly positive but from a less influential source, so it should have a minimal impact.\\n\\nLet\\'s assign some weights. For the first tweet, I\\'ll give it a weight of -0.5. For the second tweet, -0.2. For the third tweet, +0.5. For the fourth tweet, -0.2. For the last tweet, +0.1.\\n\\nNow, I need to calculate the average of these weights. Adding them up: -0.5 + (-0.2) + 0.5 + (-0.2) + 0.1 = -0.3. Dividing by 5 tweets: -0.3 / 5 = -0.06.\\n\\nRounding to one decimal place, the sentiment score is -0.1.\\n\\nI think that\\'s a fair assessment. The negative sentiments from the whale shorting and the negative prediction outweigh the positive sentiment from Michael Saylor\\'s statement, but the overall sentiment is still slightly negative.\\n\\nNow, I need to identify the key tweets. The first tweet from Whale Alert is key because it\\'s from a credible source and indicates a significant bearish move. The third tweet about Michael Saylor is key because it\\'s from a highly influential figure and shows confidence in Bitcoin. The second and fourth tweets are less influential, so I\\'ll exclude them from the key tweets list. The last tweet is also less influential, but it does show some interest in Bitcoin, so I\\'ll include it as a minor key tweet.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve got it. Let\\'s put it all together.')\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We‚Äôve built a tool that pulls Bitcoin posts from X‚Äôs Filtered Stream API, filters noise with Grok-3-mini, and scores sentiment in real time with Grok-3-reasoning. It‚Äôs a lean, composable system‚Äîeach piece (streaming, filtering, scoring) slots together to deliver live market insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve learned:\n",
    "- A modular setup can often be favourable to a monolith‚Äîswap models or tune parts without breaking the whole.\n",
    "- Match tasks to model strengths, `grok-3-mini`‚Äôs speed for filtering, `grok-3-reasoning`‚Äôs smarts for sentiment.\n",
    "- Prompts are flexible‚Äîtweak them in plain English to shift focus and adjust behavior according to your needs. \n",
    "- LLMs like Grok thrive here‚Äîmultilingual, adaptable, and quick to iterate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to push it further? For high-quality tweets with links or media, let Grok dig into the content‚Äîsummarize articles or gauge visual sentiment using its [image understanding capabilities](https://docs.x.ai/docs/guides/image-understanding). Or go dynamic: have Grok craft stream rules on the fly based on real-world events (e.g., ‚ÄúBTC crash‚Äù after a dip). Experiment, tweak, and see where it takes you."
